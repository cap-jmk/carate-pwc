# Why 

Molecular representation is wrecked. Seriously! We chemists talk with an ancient language about something we can't comprehend with that language for decades. It has to stop. 

# What 

The success of transformer models is evident. Applied to molecules we need a graph-based transformer. Such models can then learn hidden representations of a molecule better suited to describe a molecule. 

Evidence of a mixed-perspective was given in [chembee](https://codeberg.org/sail.black/chembee.git)

# Scope

The aim is to implement the algorithm in a reusable way, e.g. for the [chembee](https://codeberg.org/sail.black/chembee.git) pattern.
