Analysing the raw data
========================

To analyse the raw data produced by the run, there are two ways. First, parse the 
log file of the run. But parsing the log file is rather a backup solution. 

The easiest way is to parse the .json result file. 

There is a notebook introducing you into the analysis of the raw data. By running 
the notebook you will have reproduced the plots from the publication. 

Find the notebook in the repository 

.. code-block:: bash
    
    git clone https://codeberg.org/sail.black/carate.git
    cd notebooks

You can see an Analysis.ipynb notebook there. This is the notebook I used to generate 
the plots.
